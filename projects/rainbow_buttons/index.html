        <p>I’ve recently started upgrading old elevators, with LED’s, which makes them look great. I started
with a rectangular one, for our hackerspace’s nomzknop. After that the challenge continued with the
round version.</p>

    <img src="/media/rainbow_buttons/round_finished.png" alt="Round RGBW Button" />
</div>

<p>These are the original internal pcb’s of both:</p>

    <img src="/media/rainbow_buttons/round_original.png" alt="Original Round PCB" />
</div>
<p>I’ve done quite a few iterations of the rectangular pcb, breaking some of the LED’s or having other trouble.</p>

    <img src="/media/rainbow_buttons/rect_pcb2.jpg" alt="Rectangular PCB" />
</div>
<p>It has 4 SK6812 RGBW LED’s, in comparison to the default 4 orange ones. A 2x2 header on the back exposes 5v, ground, data pin and the button lead, which connects to ground when pressed.
This is the finished frontpanel, a huge improvement in my opinion:

<p>After this, it was time for the round one.<br />
This proved a bit more of a challenge, because of the limited pcb space, and being round.
My first finished round button went into the <a href="/projects/mario_box">mario box</a>, and I only made pictures of the back and front, when it was already assembled. For our hackerspace’s light switches, I decided to document the process a lot better.
First got 2 square protoboards, by cutting with a boxcutter, and then breaking
<img id="img" src="/media/rainbow_buttons/round_pcb1.png" />
Then I made them round using the same method, and drilled 2 holes to fit the button’s plastic extruders.

After that I fit the 4 SK6812 LED’s, and soldered them in place

The button goes in the middle, and had to have the stem fit well, cutting a bit, and then adding some hotglue
<img id="img" src="/media/rainbow_buttons/round_pcb4.png" />
Then I laid out the wires to connect everything. Because it fits better, the LED’s are connected a bit unintuitively, like this:
    2  1
    3  4
Which has to be corrected in software.</p>

<p>Which gives the finished buttons:
